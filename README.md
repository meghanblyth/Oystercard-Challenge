# Oystercard-Challenge

# A program to assist transport London in operating an Oystercard system.  This program consists of an Oystercard, Station and Journey class with relevant tests. 

# Before running this program, relevant gems should be installed by typing "bundle" once in the program folder in your terminal. 

# To test this programme in IRB, please use the following commands:

# (require the file)
# > irb -r "./lib/station" 

# (create a new card)
# > card = Oystercard.new 

# (top up the card)
# > card.top_up(10)

# (touch in the card)
# > card.touch_in 

# (touch out the card)
# > card.touch_out 

# (forget to touch in the card by doing nothing. Then touch out the card again to test the fine function)
# > card.touch_out 

# (test the balance)
# > card.balance 

# (test the journey function)
# > card.journey
